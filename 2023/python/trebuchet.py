		new_knowledge (bool, optional):	It looks like some of the digits are actually spelled out with letters: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,  and nine also count as valid "digits". Defaults to False.

	Returns:
		list[int]: List of deciphered calibration values. The calibration value can be found by combining the first digit and the last digit (in that order) to form a single two-digit number.
